caption: In this program, I created over 12 projects dabble over the course of just 4 weeks. I delivered a final project that used gameification to keep players aware of climate change issues across the world. I led a final project presentation for my project  that included a live demonstration to Google employees and community leaders using effective communication skills. In addition, I gained lots of mentorship from Google employees and community leaders.
