caption: In this program, I created over 12 projects over the course of just 4 weeks. I delivered a final project that used gamification to keep players aware of climate change issues across the world. I led a final project presentation for my project that included a live demonstration to Google employees and community leaders using effective communication skills. In addition, I gained lots of mentorship from Google employees and community leaders.
