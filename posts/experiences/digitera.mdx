caption: Digitera was my first real exposure to working in tech but in just one month, alongside other developers, I was able to design a mySQL database and back-end admin page using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Jquery for a local startup for 20+ users. I also led meetings with the start-up to determine requirements, features and functionalities that need to be implemented and made modifications according to user requests.
