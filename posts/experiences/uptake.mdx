caption: During my first co-op, I redesigned REST APIs using TypeORM and NestJS to eliminate over 1000+ lines of repeated code across 30+ classes. I also helped diagnose and debug many SQL performance issues, complete key data fixes and deadlocks that helped decrease support tickets by a volume of 20%. Throughout the four months, I developed and deployed new front-end features to production via sprints across 5 different web applications using Angular, C# and ASP.NET to create a modern UI and improve user experience. In addition, I reduced defeats by writing integration and unit tests with 100% code coverage using Jest, created comprehensive test plans in TestRail and collaborated with other developers on my team using Jira, Git and Bitbucket.
