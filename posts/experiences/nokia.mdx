caption: After coding more in my free time and taking another class at school in Java, I felt I was ready to do another internship before my senior year in high school. At my time in Nokia, I firstly wrote a script in Python that helped automate over 15000 lines of JSON code for third party dependencies documentation that developers were manually writing. I also wrote a script in Java that helped convert CRON expressions from UTC time zone to userâ€™s timezone which helped update Nokia's internal web applications. Throughout the 7 weeks, I became familiar with the Git, Spring Framework, Quartz, MacOSX terminal, the Python requests library and the ins and outs of APIS.
